=== Narration ===

As I reached the counter, the robotic bartender greeted me with a good approximation of a smile.

=== Conversation with the robot bar-tender. ===

Robot Bar-tender: Hello there Mr. Deckard sir. Will it be the usual?

Deckard: I'm tired today, Robs.

Robot Bar Tender: You do seem somewhat fatigued today sir.

Deckard: Quit it with that "Sir" crap.
or: It's been a long day.

Robot Bar-tender: I am programmed to address all patrons in accordance with societal protocols Mr. Deckard sir.

Deckard: Don't be cheeky with me, Robs.

Robot Bar-tender: I am sorry if I have offended you sir. I am simply trying to follow proper protocols.

Deckard: I know, Robs. I'm just messing with you.

Robot Bar-tender: Thank you sir.

Deckard: About that drink...

Robot Bar-tender: I am highly sensitive to human emotive qualities as a part of my function. I detect that you are feeling what could be called "low". Would you like me to your usual a double sir?

Deckard: I like the sounds of that. I had to browse through a bunch of people's digital memories today while I was tracking down a minor glitch in the south-east district. You know what I realized, Robs? People are depressingly boring these days.

Robot Bar-tender: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Here is your double Gin and Tonic and Xanax. Thank-you for choosing Uncle Dave's PharmaPub!

=== Narration for if you talk to other patrons ===

The other people in the bar seemed far-off, lost in thought. At the time, I figured maybe they were all just on some new tranquilizer.

=== Narration if you try to talk to the bartender ===

I wished I had time for another drink.

=== Jensen Radio Conversation ===

Jensen: Deckard! Can you hear me?

Deckard: Jensen? Yeah - yeah I can. Why didn't you just open up a memory link?

Jensen: I can't for some reason. I'm locked out of the system. Huh. First time I've ever used the backup radios.

Deckard: Me too, I guess. What's up?

Jensen: The security room is in lockdown. I'm trapped, and I can't access anything. Could you check the status of the Memory Storage Units real quick?

Deckard: Have you tried turning it off and then on again?

Jensen: I'm sure that would go over well with everyone in the city - nothing like a hard-reset to toss a bucket of ice-water on your brain. I can't do it from the security room anyway. C'mon man, help me out.

Deckard: ... Huh. I can't access anything either. Can't store new memories or access old ones. I didn't even notice - I usually go pure biological in the evenings. How long have things been screwed for?

Jensen: About five minutes.

Deckard: Alright. I guess my day isn't over yet. Try to figure out what's going on - I'll be there soon. I'm at the Uncle Dave's right by the East Parker Station. If I'm quick, I can catch the 6:45. Just let me toss back this drink ... there. On my way.

Jensen: Thanks Buddy! See you in a bit.

Deckard: See you.

=== Walking Narration ===

I guess that's how it all started. My job's normally pretty tame. I go in, check that everything's working smoothly, maybe order a new storage units if the population's grown enough. Storing everyone's memories takes up a surprising amount of space. We've got a whole high-rise full of  storage, and if people keep insisting on holding on to their dead relatives memories, we'll probably be putting up another one pretty soon. I don't get it myself. I figure, if someone's gone, they're gone. No use keeping around ghosts - you'll just lose sleep.

=== Inside train station ===

Ticket Vendor: Attention: The train will be departing in 1 minute. *Train catches fire explosively* Attention: The train has been delayed.

=== Narration ===

So I'd be walking back to work. Great. My guess was cutting through the slums, while not being the most scenic way, would probably be the fastest.

=== Guy in the way of leaving ===

Guy: ... Hmm... and then...

Deckard: Hey, any idea what just happened to the train?

Guy: I... then I bought my ticket, then I walked down the street, then I saw the train arrive, then I entered the train station... then... then... I bought my -

Deckard: Woah, wait, that doesn't make sense. What happened first?

Guy: - bought my ticket, then I walked down the street, then I saw the train arrive, then I entered the -

Deckard: Hey buddy, you OK? / Pull yourself together!

Guy: - train station, then I... then I bought my ticket, then -

Deckard: No, no, you must have walked down the street to the train station, and then bought your ticket before you saw it arrive, right?

Guy: What? Woah, what... what just happened?

Deckard: Don't worry about it, bud. You were just confused. / Temporary insanity?

Guy: No... I felt trapped, or... lost maybe. In my thoughts. Just tracing through the last few things I remembered. How long have I been here?

Deckard: No idea.

Guy: Jesus, that was weird. Holy shit, the train's on fire! I'm out of here!*runs off-level*

=== Narration ===

Strange. I was beginning worrying that the system lockout Jensen and I were dealing with might be the result of a larger problem. Could be a safeguard in place to make sure we weren't affected by whatever had gotten to that guy. I figured I'd better hurry on through - It could be a long night. Just my luck. I hoped this one wasn't my fault.

=== Security Guard ===

Security Guard: So I grabbed my helmet from the ledge and put it on...

Then I heard a thud followed immediately by a crash...

Then I saw a green hover-car go by...

Then I left the booth to investigate....

Then I saw a black hover-car go by...

Then I quickly tossed back my coffee...

Deckard: Damn. You're stuck in a loop like the other guy.

=== Narration ===

I was starting to understand the nature of the problem. Both this guy, and the guy in the train station seemed to have their last few memories all out of order. They were stuck in a loop of I fragmented thoughts, their minds totally occupied trying to make sense of what they'd just experienced. I still didn't know what was causing it, but it seemed like helping that other guy to re-build his memories correctly had snapped him out of it. Kind of like listening to a song that's stuck in your head to get it out. I figured that if I could sort out the order of the last few things that the security guard had seen and done, then he'd be freed up and could open the gate for me. I started trying to piece it together. It was fun, almost like a game.

=== PUZZLE ===

Security Guard: And then...

Deckard: Alright, listen carefully.

Security Guard: Then I... I...

[PUZZLIN' STUFF]

=== DONE ===

Security Guard: Woah... what... what just happened?

Deckard: Welcome back to reality, buddy. You were stuck in a memory loop.

Security Guard: What?

Deckard: I'm the caretaker for the machine that stores all of our memories - the Memorial Processor. Something's happened that has trapped people inside of their memories. Could you let me into the slums? I've got to cut through to go fix this - the train's down.

Security Guard: I... damn. Yeah, sure. I feel strange, man. You don't think there's going to be any lasting effects, do you?

Deckard: My guess would be no, but I'm not really qualified to give medical advice. Could you let me through please? This really needs to be dealt with.

Security Guard: Sure, sure.

* Opens door. *

=== Narration ===
I didn't have time to talk any more.

=== Narration ===
I found myself wandering off in the wrong direction. Blaming it on the drink, I headed back.

=== Narration ===
Looked like I wasn't going to get through the checkpoint without the security guard's help.

=== Narration ===
Alright. It was time to go back to work - off to the train station.
