=== Narration ===

As I reached the counter, the robotic bartender greeted me with a good approximation of a smile.

=== Conversation with the robot bar-tender. ===
He knows my drink - I'm there too often.
>Robot Bar-tender: Hello there Mr. Deckard sir. Will it be the usual?


>I told him I was tired. He agreed.
Deckard: I'm tired today, Robs.

Robot Bar Tender: You do seem somewhat fatigued today sir.

I figured I'd mess with him a little - something to do. 
>Deckard: Quit it with that "Sir" crap.
He was picked up on my low spirits, suggested I double up on my, uh, "medication".
>or: It's been a long day.

>Robot Bar-tender: I am programmed to address all patrons in accordance with societal protocols Mr. Deckard sir.

I decided to take it a little farther. He was predictably appologetic.
>Deckard: Don't be cheeky with me, Robs.

>Robot Bar-tender: I am sorry if I have offended you sir. I am simply trying to follow proper protocols.

I let him in on the game. Confusing an android is too easy. Probably says something about me that I do it anyway.

>Deckard: I know, Robs. I'm just messing with you.

>Robot Bar-tender: Thank you sir.

[Picked up on...]
>Deckard: About that drink...

>Robot Bar-tender: I am highly sensitive to human emotive qualities as a part of my function. I detect that you are feeling what could be called "low". Would you like me to your usual a double sir?

I figured that to be a fine suggestion. I'd had a long day looking through people's boring-ass memories while I tracked down a glitch in the system. He thanked me as he handed me my double Gin and Tonic and Xanax.

>Deckard: I like the sounds of that. I had to browse through a bunch of people's digital memories today while I was tracking down a glitch. You know what I realized, Robs? People are depressingly boring these days.

>Robot Bar-tender: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Here is your double Gin and Tonic and Xanax. Thank-you for choosing Uncle Dave's PharmaPub!

=== Narration for if you talk to other patrons ===

1. The other people in the bar seemed far-off, lost in thought. At the time, I figured maybe they were all just on some new tranquilizer.

2. Yep. Still unresponsive.

3. I gave up on trying to talk to them.

=== Narration if you try to talk to the bartender, 
or go back into the bar ===

1. I wished I had time for another drink.

2. Damn. I really wanted another drink. Too bad there wasn't time.

=== Jensen Radio Conversation ===
My buddy Jensen's voice came on to my radio. We're both care-takers for the Wireless memory storage system.
>Jensen: Deckard! Can you hear me?

I wondered why he would bother with using the old radios. He told me he couldn't, he was locked out of the memory-based communication system.

>Deckard: Jensen? Yeah - yeah I can. Why didn't you just open up a memory link?

>Jensen: I can't for some reason. I'm locked out of the system.

Turned he'd gotten himself trapped in the security room somehow, some kind of system lock-down. He needed me to check it out.
Deckard: What's up?

>Jensen: The security room is in lockdown. I'm trapped, and I can't access anything. Could you check the status of the Memory Storage Units real quick?

I figured I might as well fuck with him a little, captive audience and all.
>Deckard: Have you tried turning it off and then on again?

>Jensen: I'm sure that would go over well with everyone in the city - nothing like a hard-reset to toss a bucket of ice-water on your brain. I can't do it from the security room anyway. C'mon man, help me out.

I concentrated for a moment, but there was no sensation of connection.
>Deckard: ... Huh. I can't access anything either. I didn't even notice - I usually go pure biological in the evenings. How long have things been screwed for?

>Jensen: About five minutes.

If I hurried, I could catch the 6:45.

>Deckard: Try to figure out what's going on - I'll be there soon. Just let me toss back this drink ... there. 

Alright. It was time to go back to work - off to the train station.
>Jensen: Thanks Buddy! See you in a bit.
>Deckard: Yeah man.

=== Narration ===

=== Pass accident. ===
There was a bit of a fender bender outside.

=== Inside train station ===
An announcement came on that the train was leaving. Shit.

Ticket Vendor: Attention: The train is departing. *Train catches fire explosively* Attention: The train has been delayed.

=== Narration ===

So I'd be walking back to work. Great.

=== Guy in the way of leaving ===

The repairmain seemed strangely unfazed by the explosion of fire. 

=== Talk to him ===
He was dazed and muttering.
>Train Guy: grabbing replacement coolant... then... I was entering the...

In fact, he barely seemed to know I was there.
>Jensen: Hey buddy, you know what's up with the train?
>Train Guy: ... code 1134 ... then...

Scanning him, it seemed he was stuck in a fragment loop. That's when a glitch messes up someones last few digital memories, putting them in the wrong order. The mind gets lost trying to rationalize the lack of causality.

>Jensen: [Scan him with memory debugger]
> Train Guy: *goes through list*

I jotted down his last few memories in my journal. Since I was locked out of the system, I thought that maybe walking him through the correct order of his memories might snap him out of it. I started looking around for clues. It was fun, almost like a game.

=== Puzzle ===

# I was draining the used coolant.
You drained the used coolant.

# I was walking toward the train
You walked toward the train.

# I was entering the code 1137
You entered the code 1137

# I was walking toward the storage cabinet
You walked toward the storage cabinet

# I was grabbing a container of fresh coolant
You grabbed a container of fresh coolant

# I was entering the code 1134
You entered the code 1134

*Cabinet* There was a storage cabinet, with it's keypad showing 1134: Access denied, followed by 1137: Access granted.

*puddle / footprints* There was dirty, used coolant on the floor.

=== Done ===
The guy came to, freaked out, and took off.
>Jensen: You alright now?

>Train Guy: Jesus, that was weird. Holy shit, the train's on fire! I'm out of here! *runs off-level*

> Jensen: You're welcome.

*sign* Fixing people's memories is thankless work - they never remember it.

If I took the elevator up, I'd come out on the other side of the accident, and I could take a shortcut through the slums.

=== Security Guard ===


# I heard a thud.
You heard a thud.
# I saw a green hover-car go by.
You saw a green hover-car go by.
# I heard a crash, and maybe a small explosion.
You heard a crash.
# I heard a scraping sound.
You heard a scrape.
# I saw a black hover-car go by.
You saw a black hover-car go by.
# A car alarm started going off.
The car alarm started.

Another fragment loop. I jotted down his memories. I could probably piece them together with clues from the scene of the accident. It was time to play detective again.

Deckard: Damn.

[PUZZLIN' STUFF]

*Green Car* The alarm was coming from the green car. Probably triggered by the impact.

*Scrape* There was some green paint in a smeared across the wall.

*Sandbags* Hitting the sandbags would have made for more of a thud than a crash.

*Black car* The engine on the black car probably made quite a racket when it blew.

=== DONE ===

Security Guard: Woah... what... what just happened?

He snapped out of it.
>Deckard: Welcome back to reality, buddy. You were stuck in a fragment loop.
>Security Guard: What?

There was no time to waste. He was understandably disoriented.
>Deckard: Could you let me into the slums? I've got to cut through - the train's down.
>Security Guard: I... damn. Yeah, sure. I feel strange, man. You don't think there's going to be any lasting effects, do you?

There would probably be lasting effects. He let me through.
Deckard: My guess would be no, but I'm not really qualified to give medical advice. Could you let me through please? This really needs to be dealt with.

Security Guard: Sure, sure.

* Opens door. *

*If you try to talk to him again*
I didn't have time to talk any more.

* If you try to pass the police bot without helping the security guard *

1. I wasn't going to get through the checkpoint without the security guard's help. That police-bot would fuck me up if I wasn't cleared.

2. I found myself wandering back toward the kill-zone of the police robot. Blaming it on the drink, I headed back.

3. I then decided that it was not a good day to die.

4. I kicked myself for being so stupid as to wander of in that direction again.

5. Fuck you.
