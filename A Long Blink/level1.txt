=== Narration ===

As I reached the counter, the robotic bartender greeted me with a good approximation of a smile.

=== Conversation with the robot bar-tender. ===
I'm around often enough that he knows my drink.

>Robot Bar-tender: Hello there Mr. Deckard sir. Will it be the usual?


I told him I was tired. He agreed.
>Deckard: I'm tired today, Robs.

Robot Bar Tender: You do seem somewhat fatigued today sir.

I figured I'd mess with him a little - something to do. 
>Deckard: Quit it with that "Sir" crap.
He picked up on my low spirits, suggested I double up on my, uh, "medication".
>or: It's been a long day.

>Robot Bar-tender: I am programmed to address all patrons in accordance with societal protocols Mr. Deckard sir.

I kept it up a little longer
>Deckard: Don't be cheeky with me, Robs.

>Robot Bar-tender: I am sorry if I have offended you sir. I am simply trying to follow proper protocols.

I let him in on the game. Confusing an android is too easy. Probably says something about me that I do it anyway.

>Deckard: I know, Robs. I'm just messing with you.

>Robot Bar-tender: Thank you sir.

[Picked up on...]
>Deckard: About that drink...

>Robot Bar-tender: I am highly sensitive to human emotive qualities as a part of my function. I detect that you are feeling what could be called "low". Would you like me to your usual a double sir?

I figured that to be a fine suggestion. I'd had a long day looking through people's boring memories while I tracked down a glitch in the system. He thanked me as he handed me my double Gin and Tonic and Xanax.

>Deckard: I like the sounds of that. I had to browse through a bunch of people's digital memories today while I was tracking down a glitch. You know what I realized, Robs? People are depressingly boring these days.

>Robot Bar-tender: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Here is your double Gin and Tonic and Xanax. Thank-you for choosing Uncle Dave's PharmaPub!

=== Narration for if you talk to other patrons ===

1. Everyone else was spaced out. At the time, I figured 'eh', must be some hot new tranquilizer or something.

2. Yep. Still unresponsive.

3. I gave up on trying to talk to them.

=== Narration if you try to talk to the bartender, 
or go back into the bar ===

1. I wished I had time for another drink.

2. I figured, one more... couldn't hurt - No. no. There was no time.

3. God damn it I just wanted another drink! Fucking problem could go fix itself.

=== Jensen Radio Conversation ===
My buddy Jensen's voice came on to my radio. We're both care-takers for the city's Wireless memory storage system.

>Jensen: Deckard! Can you hear me?

I wondered why he was bothering with the old radios. Apparently, he had to - he was locked out of the memory-link communication system.

>Deckard: Jensen? Yeah - yeah I can. Why didn't you just open up a memory link?

>Jensen: I can't for some reason. I'm locked out of the system.

Turned he'd gotten himself trapped in the security room somehow, some kind of system lock-down. He needed me to check it out.
Deckard: What's up?

>Jensen: The security room is in lockdown. I'm trapped, and I can't access anything. Could you check the status of the Memory Storage Units real quick?

I figured I was pretty much obligated to fuck with him a little bit, captive audience and all.
>Deckard: Have you tried turning it off and then on again?

>Jensen: I'm sure that would go over well with everyone in the city - nothing like a hard-reset to toss a bucket of ice-water on your brain. I can't do it from the security room anyway. C'mon man, help me out.

I concentrated for a moment, but there was no sensation of connection.
>Deckard: ... Huh. I can't access anything either. I didn't even notice - I usually go pure biological in the evenings. How long have things been screwed for?

>Jensen: About five minutes.

I'd have to go in. If I hurried, I'd catch the 6:45.

>Deckard: Try to figure out what's going on - I'll be there soon. Just let me toss back this drink ... there. 

Alright. It was time to go back to work - off to the train station.
>Jensen: Thanks Buddy! See you in a bit.
>Deckard: Yeah man.

=== Pass accident. ===
There'd been a bit of an accident outside the pub.

*Car Accident* I thought about my ex-wife.

=== Inside train station ===
An announcement came on that the train was leaving. Missed it.

Ticket Vendor: Attention: The train is departing. *Train catches fire explosively* Attention: The train has been delayed.

=== Narration ===

So I'd be walking back to work. Great.

=== Guy in the way of leaving ===

The repairmain seemed strangely unfazed by the explosion of fire. 

=== Talk to him ===
>Train Guy: grabbing replacement coolant... then... I was entering the...

He was dazed and muttering something.
>Jensen: Hey buddy, you know what's up with the train?
>Train Guy: ... code 1134 ... then...

When I scanned him, it turned out he was stuck in a fragment loop. That's when a glitch messes up someones last few digital memories, puts them in the wrong order.
>Jensen: [Scan him with memory debugger]
> Train Guy: Then I... then I... wait but then...

The mind gets lost trying to rationalize the lack of causality. This guy would just going over his last few memories until the order was repaired.
>Jensen: Hey buddy, could you list off your last few memories for me please? 
>Guy *goes through list*

Normally I would just jack in and fix the glitch, but since I was locked out, I figured I'd try vocally walking him through the correct order. It might snap him out of it. I started searching around for clues.

=== Puzzle ===

# I was draining the used coolant.
You drained the used coolant.

# I was walking toward the train
You walked toward the train.

# I was entering the code 1137
You entered the code 1137

# I was walking toward the storage cabinet
You walked toward the storage cabinet

# I was grabbing a container of fresh coolant
You grabbed a container of fresh coolant

# I was entering the code 1134
You entered the code 1134

*Cabinet* There was a storage cabinet, with it's keypad showing 1134: Access denied, followed by 1137: Access granted. I wrote it all down in my journal.

*puddle / footprints* There was dirty, used coolant on the floor. Probably came from the train.

=== Done ===
The guy came to, freaked out, and took off.
>Jensen: You alright now?
>Train Guy: Jesus, that was weird. Holy shit, the train's on fire! I'm out of here! *runs off-level*

*sign* Fixing people's memories is thankless work - they never remember it. 
> Jensen: You're welcome.

If I took the elevator up, I'd come out on the other side of the accident, and I could take a shortcut through the slums.

=== Security Guard ===

He was looking suspiciously vacant.

>Security Guard: Then... I... wait, that can't be right...
>Jensen: Hey, could you list off the last few things you remember for me?

# I heard a thud.
You heard a thud.
# I saw a green hover-car go by.
You saw a green hover-car go by.
# I heard a crash, and maybe a small explosion.
You heard a crash.
# I heard a scraping sound.
You heard a scrape.
# I saw a black hover-car go by.
You saw a black hover-car go by.
# A car alarm started going off.
The car alarm started.

Another fragment loop. I jotted down his memories. I could probably piece them together with clues from the scene of the accident. It was time to play detective again.

Deckard: Damn.

[PUZZLIN' STUFF]

*Green Car* The alarm was coming from the green car. Probably triggered by the impact.

*Scrape* There was some green paint in a smeared across the wall.

*Sandbags* Hitting the sandbags would have made for more of a thud than a crash.

=== DONE ===

Security Guard: Woah... what... what just happened?

He snapped out of it.
>Deckard: Welcome back to reality, buddy. You were stuck in a fragment loop.
>Security Guard: What?

He was understandably disoriented, but there was no time to waste. Fragment loops are typically rare -  Two so close together didn't bode well.
>Deckard: Could you let me into the slums? I've got to cut through - the train's down.
>Security Guard: I... damn. Yeah, sure. I feel strange, man. You don't think there's going to be any lasting effects, do you?

There would probably be lasting effects. He let me through.
Deckard: My guess would be no, but I'm not really qualified to give medical advice. Could you let me through please? This really needs to be dealt with.

Security Guard: Sure, sure.

* Opens door. *

*If you try to talk to him again*
I didn't have time to talk any more.

* If you try to pass the police bot without helping the security guard *

1. I wasn't going to get through the checkpoint without the security guard's help. That police-bot would fuck me up if I wasn't cleared.

2. I found myself wandering back toward the kill-zone of the police robot. Blaming it on the drink, I headed back.

3. I then decided that it was not a good day to die.

4. I kicked myself for being so stupid as to wander of in that direction again.

5. Fuck you.
