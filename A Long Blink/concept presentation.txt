	In the not-too-distant future, Humanity's memories are wirelessly stored in a central computer called 'The Memorial Processor'. These memories are much like their organic counterparts. They're recalled and remembered in exactly the same way, but more vividly and accurately due to the extreme density of digital storage. The ability to extract and store memories independant of the mind means more than just stronger memories: humans can share memories.
	For the elite, the mechanism allows essentially telepathic communication via rapidly alternated recall of a shared memory. It has initiated an unprecedented leap in human knowledge and understanding. Much unskilled work has been automated out of existence, and the state provides the basic needs for all regardless of contribution. The majority of society simply does as it pleases.
	For the urban poor, this means accessing proffessionally recorded memories that can replace cinema, augment bland and easily produced food-replacements, or even illegally replicate the experiences of mind-altering drugs and sexual encounters. For some in the dreggs of society, the word 'vicarious' has new meaning: they spend nearly every waking moment in the memories of others. They're not permitted to share memories like the upper class, lest they organize and revolt, but few think of doing so.
	You play as John Stanton, care-taker for the Memorial Processor. When a hacker injects an infinite-loop memory into the minds of your city, it's up to you to help select citizens re-build their minds enough to aid you in investigating and removing the offending memory. The Cyber Punk world of <TITLE> is a world of looming contrasts: rich and poor, new and old, despair and elation. At the center of it all is the monolithic Memorial Proccessor. Through the memory reconstruction puzzles that form the core mechanic of the game, you'll explore this world and eventually make your own choice: Perfect slavery, or broken freedom?
